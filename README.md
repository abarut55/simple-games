## Description

I'm still developing an arcade where players will be able to enjoy some of my
all-time favorite old-school games. But this time I am mainly forcing on the adventure game.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* C++ version 17
* Run on Mac or Window

### Executing program

* Run main
* Choice any game
* Play game until win/lose or exit
* Either play new game or option to exist program

## Help

Bugs that need to be fixed:

* The madlibs.txt shows up in cmake-build folder

## Future Work

* Add new components from upcoming modules
* Try to play games outside the command line
