## Description

Simple-Game is a C++ project I'm currently developing that features several adventure game options for players to choose from. It's designed to run on both Mac and Windows operating systems, and I've implemented input validation and error handling to ensure a smooth gaming experience. In the future, I plan to add new features to enhance gameplay and explore options for making the game accessible outside of the command line.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* C++ version 17
* Run on Mac or Window

### Executing program

* Run main
* Choice any game
* Play game until win/lose or exit
* Either play new game or option to exist program

## Help

Bugs that need to be fixed:

* The madlibs.txt shows up in cmake-build folder

## Future Work

* Add new components from upcoming modules
* Try to play games outside the command line
